/*
Better idea (optimized):

Check divisibility from 2 up to âˆšn.
Because if n has a factor larger than âˆšn, the corresponding
smaller factor must already have been found.
ðŸ‘‰ Example: 36
Factors: (2Ã—18), (3Ã—12), (6Ã—6) [ so, here i = 2,3,4,5,6 are taken for checking , but the loop 
                                 will end when only one case of divisor is found ,here it will be 
                                 i=2 ; and it will show outpur as ** not a prime number **]  

Notice: once we reach âˆš36 = 6, weâ€™ve already checked all smaller pairs.
So checking up to âˆšn is enough
