print("""What is poetry?
that pair of eyes- murky, dreamy,
the kind you wish would engulf you whole
and you would not flinch, for it is him.
That voice- warm like honey in the cold,
soothing my soul without me
needing a single utterance
that is poetry.
The way he says my name,
like it holds all the weight in the world
the way he listens, really listens
like every word of mine deserves a home,
the way he looks out for me,
like I am a ten year old all over again
that is poetry.
Amidst the crowd, my eyes find his,
my fidgety pair meeting his steady ones
and he smiles- that reassuring smile,
the kind that could stitch
your wretched soul back together,
and paint your somber, black world
into every hopeful shade of gold
that is poetry.
What is poetry?
his care, his silence, him.
To me, he is a poem, personified.
I could write him for eternity,
thought trailing thought, line upon line,
and call that poetry.""")
